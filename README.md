# Google Gemini Token Counter

This is a simple web app which calculates the number of tokens in a text according to the Google Gemini API. **Will help while tweaking prompts for Gemini API.**

To get the tokens it calls a flask based simple api endpoint(not a gemini api) which is deployed on vercel(will open source soon).
